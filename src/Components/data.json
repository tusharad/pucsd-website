    "post":"The Department is one of the earliest CS Departments started in Indian Universities. Back in 1980, when computer science was little known and the word IT didn't exist, a one-year programme was started towards the B.Sc. (Applied) degree in Computer Science. The M.C.A. programme was launched in 1983, the M.Tech. degree programme in 1985, and the one year B.Sc. (Applied) programme was upgraded to a two year M.Sc. in Computer Science in 1986."
